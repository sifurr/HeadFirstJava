1. A class can have any number of these -> instance variable, getter, setter, method

2. A method can have only one of these -> return

3. This can be implicitly promoted -> argument, return

4. I prefer my instance variables private -> encapsulation

5. It really means "make a copy" -> pass by value

6. Only setters should update these -> instance variable

7. A method can have many of these -> argument

8. I return something by definition -> getter

9. I shouldn't be used with instance variables -> public

10. I can have many arguments -> method

11. By definition, I take one argument -> setter

12. These help create encapsulation -> private, getter, setter, pubic

I always fly solo -> return
